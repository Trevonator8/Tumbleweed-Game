# Tumble: The Official GitHub Repository
Welcome to Tumble!
If all you are looking for is the playable game, then follow the instructions under the **Download Game** header. If you want the source code and documentation too, follow the instructions under the **For Pros Only** header.

## Download Game
#### Please note that Tumble is only playable on Windows machines right now.
All you need to play Tumble is the "Export" folder. To access it,
1. Navigate to the `Export` folder above.
2. Download `Tumble.exe`, `Tumble.console.exe`, and `Tumble.pck`.
3. Save these files into their own folder. Note that they MUST all be in the same folder.
4. Double-click `Tumble.exe`
5. If you get a pop-up saying "Windows protected your PC", press the "More info" link and a button will appear at the bottom of the window saying "Run anyway". Click the button, and Tumble should start up.


## For Pros Only
These instructions operate under the assumption that you already have Godot installed on your device. If you don't but you still wish to follow these steps, you can download Godot for free on Steam.

To make Godot and Git work:

1. Go to documents folder (or where you keep your Godot projects) and open this in a terminal (right click and "open in terminal" for Windows).
2. Type `git clone https://github.com/Trevonator8/Tumbleweed-Game.git`
3. Open Godot launcher.
4. Click "Import" (next to Create)
5. Click Tumbleweed-Game -> Tumbleweed -> Select Current Folder
6. You now have access to the files in the godot engine.
7. You can now pull and push normally in the terminal
