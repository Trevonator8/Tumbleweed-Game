This is the main implementation of the game. When we eventually submit our project, this will be the directory where we make the executable.

To make Godot and git work:

1. Go to documents folder (or where you keep your Godot projects) and open this in a terminal (right click and "open in terminal" for windows).
2. git clone https://github.com/Trevonator8/Tumbleweed-Game.git
3. Open gidot launcher.
4. Click "Import" (next to Create)
5. Click Tumbleweed-Game -> Tumbleweed -> Select Current Folder
6. You now have access to the files in the godot engine.
7. You can now pull and push normally in the terminal
